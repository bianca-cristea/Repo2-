London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.[1] It stands on the River Thames
in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of
London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 1][10] The City of Westminster, 
to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century,[11] the name "London" has also referred
to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which largely comprises Greater
London,[13] governed by the Greater London Authority.

Paris (French pronunciation: is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than
105 kmÂ² (41 sq mi),[5] making it the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2020.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres
of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system of street lighting, 
in the 19th century it became known as "the City of Light".[7] Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.
